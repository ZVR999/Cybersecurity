# Cybersecurity Portfolio



Hello and welcome to my portfolio!

I'm in the processing trying to figure out how to display my skills and whatnot. When completed, you'll see a site with the majority of what you'd like to see about a candidate. Proof of their skills, certs, projects being worked on, goals (both short and long term), and of course a blog showing how the person thinks and goes about err.. pretty much everything :) 


IMPORTANT: The template seen in this repository (Report_Template.pdf) will be used to help display professionalism in addition to proof of skills. This template is in progess and likely to be updated mulitple times in the coming months.



Overview of Portfolio:

1. Use tools and resources to perform penetration tests, create reports, and build exploits/malware for red foundation.

2. Perform hardening, proper configurations, and more for blue foundation.

3. General information I learn that isn't tailored specifically for red or blue foundation will be added to the general foundation.

4. Disk imaging, captured/active logs, and more will be used for forensic foundation.

END RESULT

Proven competency of being able to:
    
    A. Perform regular penetration tests with reports.

    B. Understand and eventually build out my own exploits/malware.

    C. Use logging, disk imaging, etc. for forensic practice.

    D. Show experience with hardening systems and following best practices for configurations/encryption/etc.
    
    E. Utilze all 4 foundations together to grow and to become more capable in the Cybersecurity field!
