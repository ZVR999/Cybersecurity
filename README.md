# Cybersecurity Portfolio



Hello and welcome to my portfolio!

I'm in the processing trying to figure out how to display my skills and whatnot. When completed, you'll see a site with the majority of what you'd like to see about a candidate. Proof of their skills, certs, degrees, and projects being worked on (FORMAT UPDATE: Portfolio will now only show 4 projects that will be worked on as I gain more certs and work towards my degrees in Cybersecurity)

This portfolio is hosted through gitpages at https://zvr999.github.io/Portfolio/


IMPORTANT: The template seen in this repository (Report_Template.pdf) will be used to help display professionalism in addition to proof of skills. This template is in progress and is likely to be updated mulitple times in the coming months. This template will be used with projects and walkthroughs.



Overview of Portfolio:

NEW UPDATE:

- Portfolio will now only show About Me, a picture, Contact Me, and 4 projects that will be constantly worked on here and there while I'm in college.

Projects:

1. Use VirtualBox to host VMs in order to use VMs, tools, and resources to perform penetration tests, create reports, and build exploits/malware for red foundation.

2. Use VirtualBox and host Linux and Windows VMs to practice hardening, proper configurations, and more for blue foundation.

3. Use VirtualBox and host VMs that will log and monitor attacks used for red foundation for forensics.

4. Create a full stack web application (still debating on the app's purpose, but I can still build out login pages and routes in the mean time).


END RESULT:
    
    A. Perform and demonstrate regular penetration tests with reports.

    B. Understand and eventually build out my own exploits/malware.

    C. Use logging, disk imaging, etc. for forensic practice.

    D. Show experience with hardening systems and following best practices for configurations/encryption/etc.
    
    E. Show competency with full stack development : )
