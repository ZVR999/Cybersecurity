# Cybersecurity Portfolio

THE BELOW IS BEING REDESIGNED

DESIGN LAYOUT


Sooooo, this got overwhelming real quick xD. 

Let's see.. So I'm thinking I'll use this repo with Git Pages to host my portfolio.

Things to include:

- Background of this dude typing

- Up to date picture since sweet god man have you seen your own pic on here?

- Blue/Red/Forensic/General Foundations. Probably in their own folders with subfolders

- Daily Blog Updates

- Mini goals and their achievement dates

- Primary goals



Hello and welcome to my portfolio!

I'm in the processing trying to figure out how to display my skills and whatnot.  So far the above feels right. You see a site with the majority of what you'd like to see about a candidate. Proof of their skills, certs, projects being worked on, goals (both short and long term), and of course a blog showing how the person thinks and goes about err.. pretty much everything :) 



Overview of Portfolio:

1. Use tools and resources to perform penetration tests, create reports, and build exploits/malware for red foundation.

2. Perform hardening, proper configurations, and more for blue foundation.

3. General information I learn that isn't tailored specifically for red or blue foundation will be added to the general foundation.

4. Disk imaging, captured/active logs, and more will be used for forensic foundation.

END RESULT

Prove competency of being able to:
    
    A. Perform regular penetration tests with reports.

    B. Understand and eventually build out my own exploits/malware.

    C. Use logging and monitoring tools for forensic practice.

    D. Utilze all 4 foundations together to grow and to become more capable in the Cybersecurity field!
