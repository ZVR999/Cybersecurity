For this exercise I connected the kali and meta VMs together under an internal network, set their ips, made sure they could see each other, and then brought up the website being hosted by the meta VM by type in 10.11.1.3 (meta's ip) in the firefox browser on the kali VM.

1. Used the "gobuster dir -u 10.11.1.3 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt 

2. dir = directory/file enumeration mode , -u = the url/address to work on, -w = the wordlist being used to enumerate (using the built-in wordlist that comes with gobuster install)

3. Now I can see the pages that gobuster was able to enumerate with the wordlist choosen.

4. Next enumerate futher on the pages being found by adding them placing them in the command above and switch up the wordlist being used. For example, "-u 10.11.1.3/test" and -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-small.txt" This may not bring up new information, but it's best to try new wordlist since you never know what word could help you see a new page.

5. During this process when finding pages, I brought up each page using firefox to see what I've uncovered. Interesting thing to note is that I wasn't able to bring up the php admin site until I type it in exactly as seen from the gobuster results. Good to know that websites can be case sensitive, I didn't know this was a thing.

6. Found a new page when trying out new wordlists and when using dirbuster (the GUI version of gobuster << not 100% on that lol) "10.11.1.3/mutillidae" so cool seeing the value of enumeration and how fun it is to bring up new pages that I didn't know about.
