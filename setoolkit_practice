Today I was going through my course work and came across a toolkit called setoolkit.

This toolkit is very advanced but I had fun using the toolkit's site cloner to harvest credentials.

Commands used:

1. setoolkit
2. Option 2 for website attack vectors
3. Option 5 Web jacking attack method
4. Option 2 site cloner
5. Type in a site many people use like reddit.com
5. Type in IP of attacking computer/VM (so my kali host's ip)
6. Open firefox and put my kali's IP address in the URL section
7. Grab the link and pretend I sent it to a victim.
8. Click the link as the victim and try to login with fake username and password
9. In the terminal that's using the setoolkit, what the username and password come through in plain text in the format POSSIBLE USERNAME POSSIBLE PASSWORD

So cool.

Interesting finding I came across is that when trying to clone reddit.com. I was unable to figure out how to get a victim to even get to the link created by the setoolkit.
Something about the way reddit is built somehow catches the redirect to a clone site and stops it from ever opening on the victim's computer.

However, when using facebook.com, I had no issues getting the victim (me lol) to see the fake site, who then entered in the credentials leading to the compromise.

I'll add the pics to this repository for proof and to help clarify what I was doing.
