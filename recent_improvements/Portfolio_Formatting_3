-Removed all "Foundations" after reviewing example portfolios
-Replaced them with holders for projects that I will work on while in college
-I will still continue to complete walkthroughs and what not in order to gain exposure to new tools while also getting practice writing reports. The templates for these reports will continue to improve for professionalism until I believe the formatting for the reports looks almost too professional xD
